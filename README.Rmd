Coursera-Exploratory Data Analysis - Project 1
==============================================

Intorduction
----------------------------------------------

This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository
[id]: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/, 
a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” which I have made available on the course web site:

* Dataset: Electric power consumption [id]: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip

* Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.


Dataset Description
--------------------------------------------------
The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

Loading Data
-----------------------------------------------------
When loading the dataset into R, please consider the following:

* The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns. First calculate a rough estimate of how much memory the dataset will require in memory before reading into R. Make sure your computer has enough memory (most modern computers should be fine).
* We will only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02. One alternative is to read the data from just those dates rather than reading in the entire dataset and subsetting to those dates.
* You may find it useful to convert the Date and Time variables to Date/Time classes in R using the 𝚜𝚝𝚛𝚙𝚝𝚒𝚖𝚎()  and 𝚊𝚜.𝙳𝚊𝚝𝚎() functions.
* Note that in this dataset missing values are coded as ?.

Making Plots
------------------------------------------------------
* Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. Your task is to reconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.
